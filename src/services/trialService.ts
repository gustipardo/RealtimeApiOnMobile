 *     touching the network. Matches checkTrialStatus's bypass.
 *   - Payment required: calls the `recordSession` Cloud Function, which
 *     atomically increments sessionCount and returns the post-increment
 *     status. Subscribed users are no-ops server-side; the client still
 *     gets a TrialStatus back so the caller doesn't branch on the result.
 *
 * The function is best-effort: if it fails (network blip, function
 * unreachable), the session still proceeds — the worst case is that the
 * user gets one extra session beyond the cap before the next record
 * succeeds. We log the error rather than throwing, so the session start
 * is never blocked on a quota write.
